# Responsive Styles

Responsive layouts often require adjusting styles along a singular dimension like font-size, margin, padding, and width. Instead of manually managing media queries and adding nested style objects, Styled System offers a convenient shorthand syntax for adding responsive styles using a mobile-first approach. This syntax allows managing responsive typography and layouts more efficiently.

All style utilities in Styled System add props that accept arrays as values for mobile-first responsive styles.

```jsx
import { Box } from '@nimbleuikit/atoms';

<Box
  width={[
    1, // 100% below the smallest breakpoint
    1 / 2, // 50% from the next breakpoint and up
    1 / 4, // 25% from the next breakpoint and up
  ]}
/>

// responsive font size

<Box fontSize={[1, 2, 3, 4]} />

// responsive margin

<Box m={[1, 2, 3, 4]} />

// responsive padding

<Box p={[1, 2, 3, 4]} />
```

## What it does

The shorthand is an alternative to manually writing media queries.

Given the following:

```jsx
<Box width={[1, 1 / 2, 1 / 4]} />
```

Styled System, with a CSS-in-JS library, will generate something like the following CSS:

```css
.Box-hash {
  width: 100%;
}

@media screen and (min-width: 40em) {
  .Box-hash {
    width: 50%;
  }
}

@media screen and (min-width: 52em) {
  .Box-hash {
    width: 25%;
  }
}
```

## Using objects

Alternatively, you can define breakpoints with aliases and use plain objects as values. Any undefined alias key will define the base, non-responsive value.

```jsx
// theme.js
const breakpoints = ["40em", "52em", "64em", "80em"];

// aliases
breakpoints.sm = breakpoints[0];
breakpoints.md = breakpoints[1];
breakpoints.lg = breakpoints[2];
breakpoints.xl = breakpoints[3];

export default {
  breakpoints,
};
```

Then, use these aliases in your components:

```jsx
<Box width={{ _: 1, sm: 1, md: 1 / 2, lg: 1 / 4 }} />
```
